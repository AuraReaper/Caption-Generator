## Multi-Modal Captioning Workflow

### Phase 1: Image Captioning
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
 - Dataset Selection: Use large-scale datasets like MS COCO, Flickr8k, Flickr30k.
 - Image Processing: Resize images to 224x224 pixels.
 - Caption Tokenization: Tokenize text captions using Word2Vec, BERT.
 - Vocabulary Creation: Build a vocabulary from captions; handle OOV words using special tokens.
 - Padding & Truncation: Ensure uniform token sequence lengths.

2. **Model Architecture**
 - Backbone Model (CNN): Use pre-trained models like ResNet or EfficientNet for feature extraction.
 - Sequence Model (RNN): Apply LSTM/GRU with attention mechanisms.
 - Attention Mechanism: Focus on specific image regions during caption generation.

### Phase 2: Video Captioning
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
 - Dataset Selection: Use datasets like MSR-VTT, MSVD.
 - Video Processing: Extract frames, similar to image processing.
 - Temporal Segmentation: Break video into clips with corresponding captions.

2. **Model Architecture**
 - Video Encoder: Apply 3D CNN (I3D, ConvLSTM) for extracting temporal features.
 - Sequence Model: Extend RNN/GRU for multi-frame analysis.
 - Spatiotemporal Attention: Implement attention mechanisms for relevant temporal segments.
